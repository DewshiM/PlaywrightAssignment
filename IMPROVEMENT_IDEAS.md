Improvement Ideas for Playwright Tests

This document outlines potential improvements to make the Playwright test suite more robust, maintainable, and scalable.


1. Visual Regression / Screenshot Testing

Capturing screenshots of critical elements or pages and comparing them against baseline images can detect unintended UI or layout changes automatically. This helps ensure the applicationâ€™s appearance remains consistent across updates.

2. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration

Integrating Playwright tests into a CI/CD pipeline ensures that tests run automatically on every code push or pull request. This helps catch failures early, improves code quality, and provides immediate feedback to developers.

Summary

These improvements aim to:

Detect UI issues early (visual regression)
Automate and streamline testing across environments (CI integration)
