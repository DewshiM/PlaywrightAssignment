Improvement Ideas for Playwright Tests

This document outlines potential improvements to make the Playwright test suite more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

1. Data-Driven Testing

Instead of hardcoding test inputs like login credentials or checkbox states, test data can be stored in external files (e.g., JSON, CSV, or .env). This allows the same test logic to run for multiple scenarios, reducing code duplication and increasing test coverage.

2. Visual Regression / Screenshot Testing

Capturing screenshots of critical elements or pages and comparing them against baseline images can detect unintended UI or layout changes automatically. This helps ensure the applicationâ€™s appearance remains consistent across updates.

3. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration

Integrating Playwright tests into a CI/CD pipeline ensures that tests run automatically on every code push or pull request. This helps catch failures early, improves code quality, and provides immediate feedback to developers.

Summary

These improvements aim to:

Increase test coverage and reduce manual effort (data-driven testing)

Detect UI issues early (visual regression)

Automate and streamline testing across environments (CI integration)
